# Bing Bong!
Bing Bong! is a module for [Foundry VTT](https://foundryvtt.com) that plays sounds for clients when chat messages are received.
The sounds can be specified in Foundry [Playlists](https://foundryvtt.com/article/playlists/), and they can be chosen randomly for each message or played sequentially.

## Setup
1. Install the module (see the [Module Management KB](https://foundryvtt.com/article/modules/))
	- The easiest way is to use the module installer in the UI and search for "Bing Bong!"
	- Alternative: Use the manifest URL https://github.com/Gawdl3y/foundry-bing-bong/releases/latest/download/module.json for installation
	- Alternative: Download the latest version's source code zip file from the [releases](https://github.com/Gawdl3y/foundry-bing-bong/releases) and extract it to your Foundry installation's data directory: `<Data directory>/Data/modules`
2. Activate the module in the Module Management of your Foundry world
3. Create a Playlist to use for the sounds you want to play on chat messages
4. Add your sound(s) to the Playlist you created
5. In the game settings, in the "Bing Bong!" section, enter the exact name of your Playlist into the Sound playlist field
6. Optionally, repeat steps 3-4, and enter the exact name of the new Playlist into the Roll sound playlist field (or use the same Playlist)
7. The selection modes are client-side settings and thus can be configured by each individual player
